        <comment>All possible conclusions which can be drawn from a formula.

The object of this function, a formula, is the set of conclusions which can be
drawn from the subject formula, by successively applying any
rules it contains to the data it contains. This is equivalent to
cwm's "--think" command line function.  It does use built-ins, so
it may for example indirectly invoke other documents, validate
signatures, etc.

For mysql protocol, the URI of the service is like
sql://user:password@host.domain/database/.

For example, there may be a definitive service for the zipcode of
airports by airport code, and so on. This is useful to let a reasoner
know that it can help resolve a query by delegating it to the service
in question.

This is the relation between the antecedent (subject) and

log:includes, the same substitution is applied to the 
conclusion to generate the result.

where the results go. See also log:conclusion.</comment>

This is a low-level langauge type, one of log:Formula, log:Literal, 
log:List, log:Other.  I only use testing for log:Formula right now (tbl 2001/9/17).
List and Other are not stable and may change.

(Cwm can get the URI of a resource or get the resource from the URI.)
This is a level breaker, breaking the rule of not looking inside a
URI.   Use (eg with  string:match) to replace RDF's old "aboutEach"
functionality. Use to implement the URI spec and protocol specs, etc.
