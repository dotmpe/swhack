<h2>by Release 0.9 (may be skipped)</h2>

<p></p>

<p>(no enhancements except tackling of bugs in bug system)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reification: write it up - in tutorial and some reference form
    (ontology comments? DesignIssues? )</li>

  <li>--think --filter combination. The application of rules to the
    [notional] deductive closure of a formula is a function which is equally
    valid in forward and backward chaining systems. Providing it will allow
    the same problems to be tackled by different techniques, and different
    systems and clones.</li>
  <li>connect with semwebcentral <em>(Now exists on semwebcentral as much as
    it can link to its w3.or home 2004/9/1)</em></li>
  <li>W3.org homepage announcement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Release">by Release 1.1 2004/10/?? (Requires Python 2.3)</h2>

<p>This contains performance work which would have been been in 0.9 except
for unexpected medical situation. This will use Python sets where appropriate
(instead of homebrew sets or sequences) and will therefore <strong>require
python 2.3.</strong></p>

<h2>Longer Term</h2>

<p></p>

<p>There is no timescale for these enhahcements, as they are not subject to
existing funded development or volunteer commitment. Bother are of course
welcome at any time!</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Performance: Make test/perform test suite with standard tests so as to
plot perfromance changes version to version.</p>

<p>Develop specific benchmarks for specific problems, such as pipelineable
cases, large store/small rules, large rules/small data, etc.. Include
feedback from users to characterize different types of way in whic cwm is
used.</p>

<h3>Clones</h3>

<p>Cwm demonstrates the power of a particular langauge and a particular
general-purpose tool. Encourage and liaise with compatible systems, and share
test data. Work to define subsets of the rule langauges which work with
different types of engine.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rete rule-based system</li>
  <li>Backward-chaining systems, eg Euler.</li>
  <li>Compiled systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p></p>

<p>N3 grammar close the loop: Connect N3 grammar to syntax tests by
generating parser directly from the grammar. . Closing the loop on the
syntax. We have a definition of the N3 syntax in N3. This is only a form of
documentation until we have automatically generated a parser and/or a test
suite from that syntax definition. A straightforward job - We have a syntax
validator based on the BNF in RDF already. The interesting bit is the
ontology for annotating the BNF grammar with RDF production rules, because it
could then be reused to annotating foreign and legacy grammars to enable
automatic extraction of RDF from them. (Apart from the niceness of having
something defined it itself of course.) (<em>July 2004 this is done without
the grammar annotation necessary to actually generate triples in the
store</em>)</p>

<p>RDF Output - Use Collections for lists.</p>

<p>N3 syntax - test set syntax (,) (&lt;a&gt;,) (&lt;a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;)</p>

<p>Extended RDF output syntax for formulae (how? have RDF Core locked
<em>all</em> the exits? Prevents RDF2 not superset of RDF/XML1)</p>

<h3>Query/Inference</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Built-ins for lists. in (needs muli value function, below); append,
prepend, second..seventh, last, concat.</p>

<p>Sets, plus builtins, see syntax in N3. Information is lost, and
optimizations are lost, when sets are actually represented as ordered lists
because that is the only syntax easy to use in RDF. owl:oneOf provides the
constructor for sets.</p>

<p>Build cwm on python sets, requiring python 2.3, to gain speed.</p>

<p>Builtins extracting closed world data: s=Q(F, y, G) is set of x such that
formula F.substite((y, x)) log:includes G.</p>

<p>Symbols used as variables as separate python class - save some time
checking occurrences</p>

<p>Paramodulation - smushing built into store. Reuse redirection used for
lists?</p>

<p>Builtin operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Return many bindings from builtin eg list:in, os:argv</li>
  <li>Fairly complete XQ functions and operators implementations (use same
    URIs?)</li>
  <li>Extract datatype, language and string from a literal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove all vestiges of the old pair represetation of symbols.</p>

<p>Implement backward chainer (like Euler) on the same store. Allow forward
and backward chainers to interact, share built-ins.</p>

<h3>Store</h3>

<p>Implement versions of the store based on Redland, Jena, etc.</p>

<p>Implement rete method. Rules with state as objects. <em>&lt;= student
project?</em></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Net</h3>

<p>Implement <strong>persistent cache</strong> - make an ontology (based very
stongly on HTTP headers) for recording the results of an HTTP (etc) get.
Store metadata about fetched ontologies. Build an index into the persistent
cache for offline working.</p>

<p>Functions: find the closure of these documents under eg --closure=ptr and
make sure than they are all in my persistent cache. Allow environment
variable to specify persistent cache mode (default: ontologies only, write to
cache when online and expiry check fails, read from cache when offline).
Provide pcache.urlopen() as a transparent extension of urlopen()</p>

<p>Persistent Cache management and software installation become the same
thing.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Remote Operation</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Support DAWG remote query protocol as client, as currently done using
SQL.</p>

<p>DAWG server.</p>

<p>Variations of DAWG using N3 where DAWG is not exactly N3.</p>

<p>IRC bot (sWBot) -- Your friendly N3-happy robotic chat room companion. See
sandbox security below.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Sandboxed version of cwm, which is immune to attacks from rules in data,
builtin functions in untrusted rules, confientiality violations by indirect
web access, and so on. While you can build a secure trusted system without
needing a sandbox at all (it isn't really the way to build one) sandboxing is
handy for things like demo servers and IRC bots.</p>
