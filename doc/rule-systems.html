<h1>Comparing Rule-Based Systems</h1>

<p>Cwm acts as a rules processor, using information written in N3
rules to guide it in manipulating the RDF/N3 information it has
stored.   While rules processors are not exactly commonplace, and
understanding them is not manditory for the working programmer, 
they do have a long and solid history.   Where does cwm fit into
that history?</p>

<p>The field is sometimes called <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?knowledge-based+system">Knowledge-Based
Systems</a> or <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?expert+system">Expert
Systems</a>.
</p>

<p>We can perhaps divide the territory into four camps, as follows.</p>

<h2>Automated Theorem Provers</h2>

<p>Automated reasoning using first-order became generally feasible in
1965 with Robinson's resolution and hyperresolution algorithms.  Today
a raft of automated theorem provers continue this tradition, but they
see little use in general computing.</p>

<p>A focal point for this research is 
<a href="http://www.tptp.org">Thousands of Problems for
Theorem-Provers (TPTP)</a>, which includes links to provers
and a conversion utility between logic languages.  You can play a
little with its <a
		   href="http://www.cs.jcu.edu.au/cgi-bin/tptp/tptp2X">web form</a> (try problem ALG001-1).
</p>

<p>In the RDF/Semantic Web community, people have used at least <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/">OTTER</a> and <a
href="http://belo.stanford.edu:8080/iwregistrar/Lookup?type=1&value=SNARK&mode=full">SNARK</a>.</p>

<h2>Logic Programming (Prolog)</h2>

<p>In 1970-1972, <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?Prolog">Prolog</a>
introduced <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?logic+programming">Logic
Programming</a>, which took a restricted form of first-order logic
(Horn clauses) and offered to prove things with them in a
deterministic order, very much like running a program.   Always chaining
backward from a query.</p>

<p>(1970-1975 also <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art19.htm">saw</a> the introduction of C, Pascal, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Microsoft BASIC.)</p>

<h2>Production Systems (OPS5, CLIPS, JESS)</h2>

<pre>
http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?production+system
http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?OPS5

Usually (but not always) chaining forward from the givens.
Same timeframe as awk.
