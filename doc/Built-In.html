<h1>Tutorial: Built-in functions Cwm</h1>

<p>The processing we have done so far involves matching existing data against
a template, and where a match occurs, generating more inferred data.   This
is much like which you do with a database using SQL, and just as with SQL, in
practice you need to be able to combine it with basic arithmetic and string
operations, and so on.</p>

<p>This is done by some magic "built-in" properties for which cwm knows the
meaning and can test the validity of a statement or calculate the rest of the
statement given part of it.</p>

<p>Built-in functions are properties which cwm can calculate the object,
given the subject.</p>

<p>Built-in inverse functions are properties which cwm can calculate the
subject, given the object.</p>

<p>Some built-ins are both.  Exampes are log:uri, the relationship between a
resource and its URI, and time:inSeconds, the relationship between a
date-time in standard string form and the date-time as number seconds since
the start of the era,  as one can work either way.</p>

<p>A complete list of of bultin- functions is available.</p>
