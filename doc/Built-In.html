<h1>Tutorial: Built-in functions Cwm</h1>

<p>The processing we have done so far involves matching existing data against
a template, and where a match occurs, generating more inferred data. This is
much like which you do with a database using SQL, and just as with SQL, in
practice you need to be able to combine it with basic arithmetic and string
operations, and so on.</p>

<p>This is done by some magic "built-in" properties for which cwm knows the
meaning and can test the validity of a statement or calculate the rest of the
statement given part of it.</p>

<p>Built-in functions are properties which cwm can calculate the object,
given the subject.</p>

<p>Built-in inverse functions are properties which cwm can calculate the
subject, given the object.</p>

<p>Some built-ins are both. Exampes are log:uri, the relationship between a
resource and its URI, and time:inSeconds, the relationship between a
date-time in standard string form and the date-time as number seconds since
the start of the era, as one can work either way.</p>

<p>A <a href="CwmBuiltins.html">complete list of of bultin- functions</a> is
available.</p>

<p>Builtin-in functions in cwm <strong>only work</strong> when they are used
inside the <strong>left-hand side of a rule</strong>.</p>

<p>They are only used to figure out what things could take the place of a 
variable.  If you add data to the stroe with a built-in function in it, it is
just stored.</p>

<p>Let's make a more complicates thermostat rule::</p>
<pre>
{ :thermostat :temp ?x.  ?x math:greaterThan "70" } log:implies { :cooling :power "high" } .
</pre>

<p>The first part, <code>:thermostat :temp ?x</code>, is statisfied by
looking in the strore, where presumably the temperature at the thermostat is
stored as, say, <code>:thermostat :temp "76.4"</code>.   Under the hypothesis
that ?x is is "76.4", then the second part, which now looks like  "76.4"
math:greaterThan "70" , is satified just by the built-in property of the
math:greaterThan operator.</p>

<p>You can use path expressions to invoke builtins, especially useful for
chaining them.</p>
<pre>{ "1".os:argv^log:uri  log:semantics ?f } =&gt; { ?f a :InputFormula }.</pre>

<p>@@explain</p>

<p>Some functions need mroe than one parameter, and in N3 they take lists.</p>
<pre>{   ((?x.tempInF "32").math:difference "0.5555") math:product ?c) } =&gt; { ?x tempInC ?c}.
 </pre>

<p>Let's look at that one without the path expressions.</p>
<pre>{   (?x.tempInF "32") math:difference ?a.
    (?a "0.5555") math:product ?c.
} =&gt; {
     ?x  tempInC ?c.
}.
 </pre>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Its useful to think of where the rule engine is
going to start with some data, which will alow it to find the values of
variables.</p>

<p>{   ?x math:greaterThan ?y.  } =&gt; { ?x  :moreInterestingThan ?y }.</p>

<p>This doesn't give cwm, a forward reasoner, much to go on. It won't list
all pairs of number where the first   is greate than the second. A backward
reasoner, such as Euler, will be able to use that.  Future semantic web
engines will get smarter about picking rules to use and algorithms to use
them with.</p>
