<p>Cwm is a general-purpose data processor for the semantic web, somewhat
like sed, awk, etc. for text files or XSLT for XML. It is a forward chaining
reasoner which can be used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering
information. Its core language is RDF, extended to include rules, and it uses
RDF/XML or RDF/N3 (see <a href="../Primer">Notation3 Primer</a>)
serializations as required.</p>

<p>Cwm is <a href="../#L88">written in python</a>; it is part of <a
href="../">SWAP</a>, a Semantic Web Application Platform.</p>

<h3><a name="Security" id="Security">Security Issues</a></h3>

<p>Be careful when using rules from an untrusted source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rules can read data from the web, indirectly letting data out by the
    URIs they use.</li>
  <li>Rules can take up your resources such as processor time and memory.</li>
  <li>Rules can pick data up from within the web you have access to,
    including confidential files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be carfeul even when using cryptography. I am not an expert but a few
things to watch are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allways think where the weakest link is. It is not always on the
  net.</li>
  <li>Where do you keep the private key, anyway?</li>
  <li>Beware of all forms of attack, including replay and man in the
  middle.</li>
  <li>Always sign some random junk as well as the critical data to prevent
    the reverse engineering of the key.</li>
  <li>Ask a crypto specialist to look over your stuff</li>
  <li>Make the techniques, rules, code. public. Public debugging is valuable.
    Trying to hide it from attackers by keeping it secret doesn't pay.</li>
  <li>This code is not guaranteed anyway, or made for production use. It is
    designed for prototyping new semantic web applications. Use at your own
    risk.</li>

<h3 id="name">About the name <em>cwm</em></h3>

<p>Originally, the name is from from "Closed World Machine" because it
processed information in a limited space, cwm does <em>not</em> make any
assumptions about a closed world. Think of it as defined area but with
openings - like a valley.</p>

</dl>

<h3>Test Driven Development (Don't trust the docs ;-)</h3>

<p>The best test of works is what has been tested. So the list of files in
the <a href="../test/regression.n3">regression test</a> defines the set of
features which are generally checked on each checkin. Cwm developers agree
that all the tests have to pass before code is checked in. To run the tests,
do <tt>make</tt> in the <tt>swap/test</tt> directory.</p>

<h3>Code Overview</h3>

<h4>llyn.py - The Store</h4>

<p>An in-memory store which does the inference.</p>

<h4 id="L133">notation3.py - Serializing/deserializaing RDF</h4>

<p>Originally written by Dan Connolly, uses a basic RDF stream parser
interface</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses N3</li>
  <li>Generates N3</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line form (alias n3 python notation3.py; n3 -help) allows RDF
to be parsed and re-output.</p>

<p>The module will also run as a CGI script to convert N3 to RDF M&amp;S 1.0
- by DanC magic.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="notation3.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="L311">xml2rdf.py Parsing RDF/XML</h4>

<p>Based on Python's xmllib, this parser is compatible with the RDF stream
interface of, notation3.py. It completes the square of parsers and
generators. <strong>Defunct. Now use sax parser and sax2rdf.py.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses RDF</li>
</ul>

<p>It has a command line mode for self-test purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="xml2rdf.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>cwm_xxx.py - builtin modules</h4>

<p>These are quite easy to add to</p>

<h3><a id="Design" name="Design">Design issues</a></h3>

<p>The code above investigated and raised issues discussed in the following
documents.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/DesignIssues/Notation3.html">Notation 3 - an alternative RDF
    syntax</a></li>
  <li><a href="/DesignIssues/Anonymous.html">Quantification implicit in
    anonymous nodes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>not to mention</p>
<ul>
  <li>RDFM&amp;S and schema issues</li>
  <li>The question of quoting and BagIDs etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acks">Acknowledgements</h2>

database query and mySQL interface. Sandro Hawke has made various
contributions. Thanks to Sean for his <a
href="http://infomesh.net/2001/cwm/">guide</a> to cwm. Thanks for all on
#RDFIG for being everything which is #RDFIG.</p>
