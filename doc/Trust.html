Reaching Out Onto the Web</p>

<h1>Trust</h1>

<p>In the real world, you don't want a program doing things without being
careful. On eof the more difficult things is fguring out what rules you
really use for deciding what data to trust. The Semantic Web doesn't make
that social problem much easier. When you have figured out a trust model, the
Semantic Web allows you to write it down. Not only that -- if we introdcue
cryptographic built-in functions, we can actually make a system whcih will
use public key cryptography to check the authenticity of data.</p>

<p>This can of course get very big, and as complicated as your social or
business environment. However, we can give a taste with a simple example of
delegated authority.</p>

<h2>Delegated authority </h2>

<p>Suppose we want to set up an access control system for the W3C <em>Member
site</em>.  (Yes, even though companies support W3C just because is a good
thing, many quite reasonably need this "what's in it for me?" justification).
</p>

<p>We will formalize the social arrangements  and then we will write the
rules which encapsulate those arranegments so that they can be followed by a
machine.  Let's just take the case of a web page which is only accessible to
W3C members.  What does that mean? Well, when a company or organization joins
the W3C Advisory Committee representative is chosen as the liaison between
everyone at the organization and everything happening at W3C.  Currently
(2003) when someone says they belong to a company and want to acecss the
member site in that role, we check, by email, with the AC rep.   Let's design
a system to do it with digital signature.</p>

<p>In this picture, Alan Kotok is the W3C associate chairman who deals with
membership.  In this case  </p>
