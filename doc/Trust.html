Reaching Out Onto the Web</p>
</div>

<h1>Trust</h1>

<p>In the real world, you don't want a program doing things without being
careful.  On eof the more difficult things is fguring out what rules you
really use for deciding what data to trust.  The Semantic Web doesn't make
that social problem much easier. When you have figured out a trust model, 
the Semantic Web allows you to write it down. Not only that -- if we
introdcue cryptographic built-in functions, we can actually make a system
whcih will use public key cryptography to check the authenticity of data.</p>

<p>This can of course get very big, and as complicated as your social or
business environment. However, we can give a taste with a simple example.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>@@ Small trusted codebase</p>

<p>So what is this Semantic <em>Web</em>, anyway? Where does the <em>Web</em>
come in? So far you've shown us just a language for writing data.</p>
