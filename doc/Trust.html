Reaching Out Onto the Web</p>
</div>

<h1>Trust</h1>

<p>In the real world, you don't want a program doing things without being
careful. On eof the more difficult things is fguring out what rules you
really use for deciding what data to trust. The Semantic Web doesn't make
that social problem much easier. When you have figured out a trust model, the
Semantic Web allows you to write it down. Not only that -- if we introdcue
cryptographic built-in functions, we can actually make a system whcih will
use public key cryptography to check the authenticity of data.</p>

<p>This can of course get very big, and as complicated as your social or
business environment. However, we can give a taste with a simple example. The
idea here is not to learn this particular cryptographic library, but to get
the feel of what can be done.</p>

<h2>Delegated authority</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to set up an access control system for the W3C <em>Member
site</em>. (Yes, even though companies support W3C just because is a good
thing, many quite reasonably need this "what's in it for me?"
justification).</p>

<p>We will formalize the social arrangements and then we will write the rules
which encapsulate those arranegments so that they can be followed by a
machine. Let's just take the case of a web page which is only accessible to
W3C members. What does that mean? Well, when a company or organization joins
the W3C Advisory Committee representative is chosen as the liaison between
everyone at the organization and everything happening at W3C. Currently
(2003) when someone says they belong to a company and want to acecss the
member site in that role, we check, by email, with the AC rep. Let's design a
system to do it with digital signature.</p>

<p><img alt="example of trust processing"

<p>In this picture, Alan Kotok is the W3C associate chairman who deals with
membership. In this case, Kari is the AC rep for W3C member <em>Elisa
Communications</em>. Alan delgates to Kari the right to say who, as a emploee
of Elisa, get access to the W3C Member Site.</p>

<p>Alan's authority to define who is a W3C is represented by a digital key.
he generates it using the command</p>
<pre>cwm access-gen-master.n3 --think --purge &gt; access-master.private</pre>

<p></p>

<p>where the access-gen-master.n3 contains:</p>
<pre>#  Generate master key

@prefix : &lt;#&gt; .
@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt; .
@prefix crypto: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto#&gt; .
@prefix string: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/string#&gt; .
@prefix acc: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/crypto/acc.n3#&gt;.

this log:forAll :x , :y.


{ :x crypto:keyLength "1024";
     crypto:publicKey :y } log:implies {
 :x a acc:MasterKeyPair; a acc:Secret.  :y a acc:MasterKey } .

log:forAll a log:Chaff.
log:implies a log:Chaff.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The <code>crypto:keyLength</code> built-in generates :x, which a string
which actually contains both the private and the public keys. This is
conventient, as anyone who knows a private key needs to keep track of which
public key goes with it. This is not a very semantic web function, as it
isn't repeatable rule you can resue - it is just a trick for generating a
key. (It will generate a different key each time, although the library at one
stage didn't do that to make debugging easier).</p>

<p>The <code>crypto:publicKey</code> builtin is a function which strips out
the private parts of a key :x, leaving only the public part :y. Note we have
class here <code>:Secret</code> which we just use for labellling things which
we don't want another person to know.</p>

<p>The log:Chaff part is to label those bits which are for deletion by the
--purge command, just to leave the key file clean of stuff we don't want.</p>

<p>Here is the complete data flow,</p>

<p>The bit at the bottom shows how the picture itself (make.svg) was
generated from the Makefile - by turning into RDF of course.  Some people
have actually started to se RDF just because of the diagram drawing facility.
 But we hope by this stage that you will have a longer term and wider vision
of the value of Semantic Web.</p>
