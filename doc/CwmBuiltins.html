<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>CanEncrypt</td><td class='comment'>PublicKeyObjects which are cabable of encrypting things</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>CanSign</td><td class='comment'>PublicKeyObjects which are cabable of signing things.
True if the algorithm is capable of signing data; returns false otherwise.
To test if a given key object can sign data, use CanSign and HasPrivate. </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>HasPrivate</td><td class='comment'>
Some keys have private parts, some don't.  This is the class of those which do.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>HashFunction</td><td class='comment'>
The crypographic hash functions are (being functions) unique and 
(the whole point of being hash functions) are, when secure, assumed
unambiguous. That is, you have the right hash you ahve the right document.
Currently (2001/9)only SHA is given that property.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>PublicKeyObject</td><td class='comment'>An object corresponding to a key for some algorithm.
    The object can hold a private and optionally a private key.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>md5</td><td class='comment'>The object is a MD5 hash of the subject.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>publicKey</td><td class='comment'>The object is a public key object that doesn't
    contain the private key data in the subject.
    This function extracts the public part.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>sha</td><td class='comment'>The object is a SHA-1 hash of the subject.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>sign</td><td class='comment'>The subject should be a list of two things,
a hash string and a key (containing private and public parts).
The obejcts is calculated as a signature string by signing
the has with the key's private part.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>verify</td><td class='comment'>If the subject is a key object containing
private and public parts and the obejct is a list of
a hash and a signature, then this is true iff the signaure is
a valid signatre of the hash with the key.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>verifyBoolean</td><td class='comment'>If the subject is a list
containg the keypair, a hash and a signature
then the object is either "1" if the signature validates
or "0" is it does not.</td></tr>
</table><h2> list</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix list: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/list#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>in</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the object is a list and the subject is in that list, then this is true.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>last</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the object is a list and the subject is the last thing that list, then this is true.
The last element can be calculated as a function of the list.
</td></tr>
</table><h2> log</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>Chaff</td><td class='comment'>Any statement mentioning anything in this class
is considered boring and purged by the cwm --purge option.
This is a convenience, and does not have any value when published as a
general fact on the web.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>N3Document</td><td class='comment'>A document which, which parsed as Notation3
as defined in general by http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html
and this schema, conveys the intent of the author by the semantics defined
on those specifications, and the semantics defined by the specifications
of any identifiers used in the document.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>Truth</td><td class='comment'>Something which is true: belive it as you would belive this.
	       Understood natively by cwm in that it will execute rules in a formula
         declared a Truth within a formula it is already taking rules from.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>conclusion</td><td class='comment'>All possible conclusions which can be drawn from a formula.

The object of this function, a formula, is the set of conclusions which can be
drawn from the subject formula, by successively applying any
rules it contains to the data it contains. This is equivalent to
cwm's "--think" command line function.  It does use built-ins, so
it may for example indirectly invoke other documents, validate
signatures, etc.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>conjunction</td><td class='comment'>"A function to merge formulae: logical AND.

The subject is a list of formulae.
The object, which can be generated, is a formula containing a copy
of each of the formulae in the list on the left.
A cwm built-in function.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>content</td><td class='comment'>This connects a document and a string that represents it.
(Cwm knows how to go get a document in order to evaluate this.)
Note that the content-type of the information is not given and
so must be known or guessed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>definitiveDocument</td><td class='comment'>	When document D is the definitiveDocument for property P,
any statement X P Y is true iff and only if the semantics of document D
include that statement.

For example, there may be a definitive document for the zipcode of
airports by airport code, and so on. This is useful to let a reasoner
know that it can extend its query to the given document.
(Cwm will do this if its mode includes "r").
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>definitiveService</td><td class='comment'>	When service S is the definitiveService for property P,
any statement X P Y is true iff and only if a query to S returns
that it is.  The protocol for the service S depends on the scheme.
For mysql protocol, the URI of the service is like
sql://user:password@host.domain/database/.

For example, there may be a definitive service for the zipcode of
airports by airport code, and so on. This is useful to let a reasoner
know that it can help resolve a query by delegating it to the service
in question.
(Cwm will do this if its mode includes "r").
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>equalTo</td><td class='comment'>Equality in this sense is actually the same URI.
Do not confuse with daml:EquivalentTo.
A cwm built-in logical operator, RDF graph level.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>forAll</td><td class='comment'>A is true for any object in place of B.
	This is NOT a real rdf property in its behaviour - a pseudoproperty.
	For examplem substitution is not permitted on its object.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>forSome</td><td class='comment'>A is true for some object for which here we use B. This
        is NOT a real rdf property in its behaviour - a pseudoproperty.
	For example, removal of it from a formula does nor
	preserve truth, and substitution is not permitted on its object.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>implies</td><td class='comment'>Logical implication. 
This is the relation between the antecedent (subject) and
conclusion (object) of a rule.
For every subsitution of variable names for symbols or literals
which maps the antecedent to a fromula which knowledge base
log:includes, the same substitution is applied to the 
conclusion to generate the result.
 
Used by cwm as the basic hook for adding inference to RDF.
See the manual to define what the knowledge base is and
where the results go. See also log:conclusion.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>includes</td><td class='comment'>One formula is subset of other.
That is, the two graphs can be matched by finding the
mapping between varibles in one and variables in the other.
Variable subsitution is applied recursively to nested formulae.
[Note forAll and forSome psuedo-statements themselves].
The information in the subject formula supports the object formula.
Understood natively by cwm in the antecendent of a rule.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>n3String</td><td class='comment'>The subject formula, expressed as N3, gives this string.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notEqualTo</td><td class='comment'>Equality in this sense is actually the same URI.
Do not confuse with daml:EquivalentTo.
A cwm built-in logical operator.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notIncludes</td><td class='comment'>The object formula is NOT a subset of subject. Understood natively by cwm. (See includes)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>outputString</td><td class='comment'>The subject is a key and the object is a string,
where the strings are to be output in the order of the keys.
See cwm --strings in cwm --help.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>parsedAsN3</td><td class='comment'>The subject string, parsed as N3, gives this formula.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>racine</td><td class='comment'>For anything identified by a URI with a fragid, this is the
thing identified by the same URI without a hash or fragid.
For anything else, it is itself.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>rawType</td><td class='comment'>
This is a low-level langauge type, one of log:Formula, log:Literal, 
log:List, log:Other.  I only use testing for log:Formula right now (tbl 2001/9/17).
List and Other are not stable and may change.
Example: semanticsOrError returns either a Formula or a String.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>rawUri</td><td class='comment'>This allows one to look at the actual string of the URI which identifies this,
for anything, even a blank node or a formula. This peeks into the internal
workings of cwm, and so is not normally used. Use log:uri instead.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>semantics</td><td class='comment'>The semantics of a document is the formula
acheived by parsing representation of the document.

(Cwm knows how to go get a document and parse it in order to evaluate this.)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>semanticsOrError</td><td class='comment'>This connects a document and either the formula it parses to,
or an error message explaining what went wromg with trying. See log:semantics.
(Cwm knows how to go get a document and parse it in order to evaluate this.)
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>uri</td><td class='comment'>This allows one to look at the actual string of the URI which identifies this.

(Cwm can get the URI of a resource or get the resource from the URI.)
This is a level breaker, breaking the rule of not looking inside a
URI.   Use (eg with  string:match) to replace RDF's old "aboutEach"
functionality. Use to implement the URI spec and protocol specs, etc.

</table><h2> os</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix os: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/os#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>argv</td><td class='comment'>The object is looked up as the literal string which was given
as the nth command line argument. 
    
    The os:argv property allows one to make statements whose interpretation
is relative to the conditions pertaining at the time of execution. Beware
of writing axioms about these, in making optimizations for example about
reuse of information between runs.  The uniqueness of this property pertains
to one run of a program.  The ont:UniqueProperty may be removed if it
messes up more complex processing.

(For example, cwm uses a "-with" argument
to indicate that the following args should be passed to the RDF system.

Example:
    cwm foo.n3 -think -with bar baz
    when processing,   {"1" os:argv "bar". "2" os:arv "baz"} will be true)

</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>baseAbsolute</td><td class='comment'>The baseAbsolute property of a URI reference string is a string
which is an (absolute) URI, generated assuming the
base of the running process.  This will, for example,
generate a file: URI from a unix relative file path when running
in file: space.  (Cwm uses the current working directory as a base
unless the --base option is given)
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>baseRelative</td><td class='comment'>The baseRelative property of a URI string is a string
which is a valid relative form of the URI, relative to the
base of the running process.  The base of a running unix
process is typically a file: URI for the file being processed,
or just the current working directory followed by a "/".

The relative form is suitable for quotation in a file
whose URI is the same (except for anything after the last slash).
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>environ</td><td class='comment'>
The os:environ property of a string is the value corresponding to
the string when looked up in the curent environment.  This is
not, of course, something of global significance: it is only
used in local processing for passing parameters into a semantic web
processor.  The subject is the name of the environment variable
and the object its value.

os:environ is a built-in function in cwm, and corresponds
to Python's os.environ[] .
</td></tr>

the object is is a regular expression in the perl, python style.
It is true iff the string matches the regexp.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notEqualIgnoringCase</td><td class='comment'>True iff the subject string is the NOT same as object string
ignoring differences between upper and lower case.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notGreaterThan</td><td class='comment'>True iff the string is NOT greater than the object
	when ordered according to Unicode(tm) code order.</td></tr>

	when ordered according to Unicode(tm) code order.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notMatches</td><td class='comment'>The subject string;
the object is is a regular expression in the perl, python style.
It is true iff the string does NOT match the regexp.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>scrape</td><td class='comment'>The subject is a list of two strings. The second string is
a regular expression in the perl, python style.
It must contain one group (a part in parentheses).  If the first string in the list matches
the regular expression, then the object is calculated as being the
part of the first string which matches the group.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>startsWith</td><td class='comment'>True iff the subject string starts with the object string.</td></tr>
</table><h2> time</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix time: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/time#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>day</td><td class='comment'>
For a date-time, its time:inSeconds is the (string represntation of)
the two-digitday of the month.

Cwm implements this as a function.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>dayOfWeek</td><td class='comment'>
For a date-time, its time:dayOfWeek is the (string reopresntation of)
the day number within the week, Sunday being 0.

Currently the result is a sinbgle digit string but don't count on it
being anything other than a valid integer represetnation.

Cwm implements this as a function.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>gmTime</td><td class='comment'>
For a date-time format string, its time:gmtime is the 
result of formatting the Universal Time of processing
in the format given.   If teh fiormat string has zero length,
then the ISOdate standrad format is used. 
[ is time:gmtime of ""]  the therefore the current date time.
It will end with "Z" as a timezone code.

Cwm implements this as a function.
Rules which use this function will of course NOT be repeatable.
</td></tr>

For a date-time, its time:inSeconds is the two-digit hour in the 24 hour clock.

Cwm implements this as a function.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>inSeconds</td><td class='comment'>
For a date-time, its time:inSeconds is the (string reopresntation of)
the floating point number of seconds since the beginning of the era
on the given system. Don't assume a particular value, always test for it.

Cwm implements this as a bidirectional function: you can calculae the
ISO date from the seconds since the beginning of the era, or vice-versa.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>localTime</td><td class='comment'>
For a date-time format string, its time:localTime is the 
result of formatting the current time of processing and local timezone
in the format given.   If the format string has zero length,
then the ISOdate standrad format is used. 
[ is time:localTime of ""]  the therefore the current date time.
It will end with a numeric timezone code or "Z" for UTC (GMT).

Cwm implements this as a function.
Rules which use this function will of course NOT be repeatable.
