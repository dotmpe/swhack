<h1>Primer: Shortcuts and longcuts</h1>

<p>You don't need to know this. It just makes life easier, and of course
helps when reading other people's work. Cwm doesn't use many of these forms
(except lists) on output, so getting cwm to input and output a file will turn
it into the form of N3 you already know.</p>

<h2><a name="Variables" id="Variables">Variables with ? and _:</a></h2>

<p>So far we have introduce variables for rules using log:forAll. We have
introduced existential variables (blank nodes) with log:forSome. These are
both special pseudoProperies which are really special langauge things. There
are shortcuts under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>When a variable is universally quantified in not the formula itself but
the surrounding formula, then you can just use ?x. This is in fact what you
want for rules whcih don't have nested formulae inside the antecentent.</p>

<p>So instead of</p>
<pre>this log:forAll :x, :y.</pre>
<pre>{ :x :parent :y } =&gt;  { :y :child :x }.</pre>

<p>you can write</p>
<pre>{ ?x parent ?y } =&gt;  { ?y :child ?x }.</pre>

<p>which means just the same. We will use this all the time when writing
simple rules. If you need the same variable to appear at several levels, then
you can't use this form.</p>

<p>The other shortcut is that if you have existentially qualified variables
in the scope of the whole document, then you can use _:a and so on. (This is
the same as the ntriples notation)</p>

<p>So instead of writing</p>
<pre>this log:forSome :a, :b.</pre>
<pre>:a :hates :b.   :b :loves :a.</pre>

<p>you could just write</p>
<pre>_:a :hates _:b.   _:b :loves _:a.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>In practice this is very ofetn used in ntriples but in N3, you can
normally use the [] syntax to avoid usiing any variables at all.</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="Puctuation" id="Puctuation">Shorthand symbols for implies,
etc.</a></h2>

<p>When it is used as a predciate (verb) in N3, <code>log:implies</code> and
=&gt; are the same; <code>owl:equivalentTo</code>and = are the same.</p>

<h2><a name="Paths" id="Paths">Paths</a></h2>

<p>Often it turns out that you need to refer to something indirectly through
a string of properties, such as "George's mother's assistant's home's
address' zipcode". This is traversal of the graph. In the N3 we have dealt
with up till now, this would look something like</p>
<pre>[is con:zipcode of [
    is con:address of [
        is con:home of [
            is off:assistant of [
                is rel:mother of :George]]]]]</pre>

<p>which reads "that which is the zipcode of that which is the address of
that which is the home of that which is the assistant of that which is the
mother of :George", which isn't very conventient to read or write. And this
is when in ant object-oriented langauge, you would just cascade methods or
attributes on properties using ".".</p>

<p>To make it easier in N3 there is a shortcut for the above would just be
written</p>
<pre>:George.rel:mother.off:assistant.con:home.con:address.con:zipcode</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The dot must be immediately followed by the next thing, with no
whitespace.</p>

<p>This is forward traversal of the graph, where with each "." you move from
something to its property. So ?x.con:mailbox is x's mailbox, and in fact in
english you can read the "." as " 's".</p>

<p>You can do backward traversal, using "^" instead of "." as punctuation. So
if :me.con:mailbox means my mailbox, then
&lt;mailto:ora@lassila.com&gt;^con:mailbox is that which has
&lt;mailto:ora@lassila.com&gt; as a mailbox. This backward traversal is less
usual - you can't do it object-oriented programming langauges -- but
sometimes its what you need.</p>

<p>Note that there isn't necessraily only one match for a path - often there
are many, when it is used on the left side of a rule.</p>
<pre>:me.rel:parent</pre>

<p>would be "Some x such that I have parent x", and</p>
<pre>:me.rel:parent^rel:parent</pre>

<p>would mean "Some y such that for some x, I had parent x and y had parent
x", or loosely, some sibling of mine. In this imaginary ontology,
".rel:child" is equivalent to "^rel:parent".</p>

<p>Whatever the sequence of "." and "^", they always are read left to right
across the page.</p>

<p>These are known as "paths". If you are used to XML, think: Xpath but
simpler. If you think of the circles and arrows graph of data, think of a
path from node to node.</p>

<h2 id="Lists">Lists</h2>

<p>A common need is to represent an ordered collection of things. This is
done in OWL as a owl:Collection. In N3, the list is represented by sepetating
the objects with whitespace and surrounding them with parenthases. Examples
are:</p>
<pre>( "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" )

( ?x  ?y )

( ?cust.bus:order.bus:number  ?cust.bus:order.bus:referncedPurchaseOrder.bus:number )</pre>

<p>These lists are actually shorthand for statements which knit them together
using owl:first and owl:rest. owl:first is the relationship betwen a list and
its foirst component. owl:rest if the relationship between a list and the
list of everything except its first element. owl:nil is the name for the
empty list. Therefore,</p>
<pre>( "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" )</pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>[ owl:first "Monday";
  owl:next [ owl:first "Tuesday";
             owl:rest [ owl:first "Wednesday";
                        owl:rest owl:nil ]]]</pre>

<p>One of the common uses of lists is as parameter to a relationship which
ihas more than one argment.</p>
<pre>(  "Dear " ?name " "," )   string:conatenation   ?salutation.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>for example, indicates that the salutation is the string concatenation of
the three strings "Dear", whatever ?name is, and a comma. This will be used
with built-in functions which we will discuss later.</p>
