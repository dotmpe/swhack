<h1>Motivations for N3</h1>

<p>The N3 language  -- and the SWAP code such as Cwm which expeiments with it
and  demonsrtates it -- were motivated by a desire to show the semantic web
working in a practical, tryable prototype, with the  minimum of fuss and
clutter. Mimumum fuss means a similicity which comes from a absense of extra
features: this suggests a tactic of reusing existing features as far as
possible - to push the bounds of one style or pattern until it is
demonstrably unrerasonable, and then to stop.</p>

<h2>N3 requirements</h2>

<h3>A data language</h3>

<p>The first task of N3 was to allow data - pure facts -to be written down
simply and easily in a text file -- or in an IRC chat channel, for that
matter.    RDF had evolved as a way of expressingany data, be it tables,
trees or mixtures of the above in a circles and arrows, but the XML format
was too verbose for use in conversaion, on a whiteboard.</p>

<p>The ";" and "," syntaxes followed from an observation that often many
values were given for the same predicate on the same subject, and much data
was given for the same subject.  </p>

<p>Most of the informatuion in most real systems is data (although the
balance between data and rules varies widely).  Even the ontology layer (OWL)
is expressable using the data langauge.</p>

<p>A goal of N3 was not only to make a concise and usable language for data,
but also to show how much could be done by using that data language.</p>

<h3>A framework for logic</h3>

<p>The semantics web layer cake is a simplified roadmap showing how many
languages of different expressive power will be useful, and must interoperate
as much as possible on the Web.</p>

<p>One aim of N3 was to make a transition to the expressive power of various
languages to include rules and queries, in as seamless a way as reasonable
from the data representation language</p>

<h3>Quoting</h3>

<p>On this Web of information, much of that information is about other
information. Indeed, the first driver for a common language for data was data
about information resources (hence the now rather outdated name <em>Resource
Description Framework</em>). In this environment, the Frege and Russel era
attempts to avoid refernce by data to data are not going to work. The
alternative is to embrace quoting - to be able to make comments in one
document about other documents without imposing any acyclic requirement on
the whole gobal system.</p>
