<h1>Motivations for N3</h1>

<p>The N3 language  -- and the SWAP code such as Cwm which expeiments with it
and  demonstates it -- were motivated by a desire to show the semantic web
working in a practical, tryiable prototype, with teh minimum of fuss and
clutter.</p>

<h2>N3 requirements</h2>

<h3>A data language</h3>

<p>The first task of N3 was to allow data - pure facts -to be written down
simply and easily in a text file -- or in an IRC chat channel, for that
matter.</p>
