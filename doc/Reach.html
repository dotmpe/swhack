<h1>Primer: Reaching out onto the Web</h1>

<p>So what is this Semantic <em>Web</em>, anyway? Where does the <em>Web</em>
come in?  So far you've shown us just a language for writing data.</p>

<p>(You <em>do</em> need to know this bit!)</p>

<h2>Looking inside web resources:   log:semantics and log:includes</h2>

<p></p>

<h2>More peeking: log;content, log:n3String, log:uri</h2>

<p></p>

<h2>Getting results from the web: log:definitiveService and
log:definitiveDocument</h2>

<p></p>

<p>By now you should know how to publish tables of useful infromation on the
semantic web. You should know how to use published data and semantic web
services and SQL servers to answer parts of your queries.   You are starting
to get into some useful scalable stuff, and the next thing you know you'll be
needing to reign in your system before it explores the whole world. You'll be
needing to think about trust.  Fortunately, you already have some of the
tools: you can write rules which keep track of  data from different places
separately.   Now all you need  is some crypto ....</p>
