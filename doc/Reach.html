<h1><a name="Primer" id="Primer">Primer: Reaching out onto the Web</a></h1>

<p>So what is this Semantic <em>Web</em>, anyway? Where does the <em>Web</em>
come in? So far you've shown us just a language for writing data.</p>

<p>(You <em>do</em> need to know this bit!)</p>

<h2><a name="Looking" id="Looking">Looking inside web resources:
<code>log:semantics</code> and <code>log:includes</code></a></h2>

<p>Life in the real world is full of data from different places. Rather than
putting all the data into one big put and believing it, rules oftenhave to
look specifically at which document said what.</p>

<p>Cwm has built-in functions to allow it to interact with the web. The
concept of a formula - a set of RDF statements - allows it to consider
seperate sets of data.</p>

<p>The basic function which connects RDF to the web is <code><dfn><a
name="semantics" id="semantics">log:semantics</a></dfn></code>. The
log;semantics of a document is the formula which one gets by parsing a
semantic web document. As it is a built-in function, when cwm needs to
evaluate it it will pick up the document (N3 or RDF/XML) and parse it,
returning the formula<a href="#L4808"><sup>1</sup></a>..</p>

<p></p>
<pre>{ &lt;foo.rdf&gt; log:semantics ?f } =&gt; { ?f a :InterestingFormula}.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Having got a formula, we can test what it has using log:includes. One
formula <code>log:incldues</code> a second formula if for each statement in
the second, there is a corresponding one in the first. This the same pattern
matching which happens with rules.</p>

<p>So let's say we we have a concept of a semantic web home page for a
person. Instead of believing anyone, we only believe that page about the
person being a vegetarian.</p>
<pre>this log:forAll :x.
{:x.:homePage log:includes { :x a :Vegetarian }}=&gt; { :x a :Vegetarian}.</pre>

<h3><a name="Implementi" id="Implementi">Implementing defaults and
<code>log:notIncludes</code></a></h3>

<p>Because the document is a finite size, you can test for what it does
<em>not</em> say, with <code>log:notIncludes.</code> Here, we have a rule
that is the specification for a car doesn't say what color it is then it is
black.</p>
<pre>this log:forAll :car.
{ :car.auto:specification log:notIncludes {:car auto:color []}}
    =&gt; {:car auto:color auto:black}.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Note the use of [] here in the nested formula as a blank node.</p>

<p>This is a way to do defaults. N3 as it is doesn't have defaults, because
on the web, you can't say "if nothing says it is another color". You can
handle defaults by first running rules to work out everything which is
specified, and then on the result of that do a <code>notIncldues</code> rule
like that above to implement the default values.</p>

<p>@@ examples</p>

<h2><a name="More" id="More">More peeking: <code>log:content</code>,
<code>log:n3String</code>, <code>log:uri</code></a></h2>

<p></p>

<p>The nice thing about log:semantics is it deals with all the web protocols
in one simple function. It is possible also to get a little more involved,
using the following functions which separate the looking up from the
parsing.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>log:content</code></dt>
    <dd>For a document, the string which was returned as the document
      contents when the URI of the resource was looked up.</dd>
  <dt><code>log:parsedAsN3</code></dt>
    <dd>For a string, the formula you get by parsing it as a Notation3
      document.</dd>
  <dt><code>log:N3String</code></dt>
    <dd>For a formula, a string which expressed that formula in N3.</dd>
  <dt>log:uri</dt>
    <dd>The uri of a resource. &lt;http://example.org/&gt; log:uri
      "http://example.org/". Normal logic processing doesn't look at URIs but
      in some cases one needs to. This is a level-breaker: it lets an N3
      system look at its infrastructure. It is a function which cwm can
      evaluate either way: resource to URI or URI to resource.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
</dl>

<p>One of the uses of this, as we will see in the next section, is to test
the digital signature of a string before accepting the data encoded in it.</p>

<h2><a name="Getting" id="Getting">Getting results from the web:</a>
<code>log:definitiveService</code>and <code>log:definitiveDocument</code></h2>

<p></p>

<p>There is some relationships for which there is just a well-defined</p>

<p></p>

<p>By now you should know how to publish tables of useful infromation on the
semantic web. You should know how to use published data and semantic web
services and SQL servers to answer parts of your queries. You are starting to
get into some useful scalable stuff, and the next thing you know you'll be
needing to reign in your system before it explores the whole world. You'll be
needing to think about trust. Fortunately, you already have some of the
tools: you can write rules which keep track of data from different places
separately. Now all you need is some crypto ....</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="L4808" id="L4808">1.</a> Of course, the value of this function
depends on the real world, which can change. Many systems either assume that
other documents won't change or accept that the information derived from it
will change with it. It is would also possible to model the time at which a
given representation of a document was returned by a server, and what expiry
date was given, and so on, but cwm does not in 2003 provide such
functionality..)</p>
