<h1>Cwm Changes 2003/08</h1>

<p>At this point cwm made a number of changes at once, so we document htem
here.</p>

<p><small><code>@prefix test:
&lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/regression#&gt;.</code></small></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>The <strong>namespaces</strong> used for lists changed from DAML to
    RDF. The namespace used for "=" switched to OWL. DAML and DAML+OIL are
    used no more, though we remember them fondly. This change actually
    shouldn't change much in many applications, where files use the
    collection syntax in RDF or the () and = syntaxes in N3. It does affect
    the order of statements cwm uses to pretty-print files.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lists</strong> are handled differently internally. This is a
    bit of a an experiment. Instead of being stored in their first/rest forms
    in the graph, complete lists are stored as List objects. Thse are first
    class objects. . 
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, <strong>you can no longer match against a list</strong>.
        Unification of formlae will catch identical lists such as ( &lt;a&gt;
        &lt;b&gt; ) matching against ( &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; ) because Lists
        are interned, but will currently NOT unify ( ?x ?y ) with ( &lt;a&gt;
        &lt;b&gt; ). This is similar to the behaviour of formulae. Watch this
        space, though,as this should change. (Tests which fail:
        test/list/list-bug{1,2}.n3)</li>
      <li>You should be able to generate lists from built-ins.</li>
      <li>The unification (query) engine was complicated by the fact that
        lists in the antecedent can be assumed as all lists exist by axiom.
        The last release of llyn had a bug (<code>test:t1018b2</code>) with
        that - and wrapping my head round that caused me to decide it was
        time for the change.</li>
      <li>In canonical comparisons, Lists are greater than literals and
        smaller than formulae. This may affect the ordering of cwm-generated
        files. Lists currently compare element by element, or if elements
        match, shortest is smallest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>New option --data</strong> strips the store down to an RDF
    graph, losing universal variables (forAll's) and any statements which
    mentoin nested formulae. --purge-rules is now deprocated and does the
    same thing. (--purge-rules sed to be a just remove things menioning
    forAll or implies.)</li>
  <li>The store is being separated into components. llyn.py was too big. The
    idea is to be able to support a redland underlying store in the future.
    The unification engine which includes the built-in function operation now
    uses the store's api to access the store without peeking into
  internals.</li>
</ol>
