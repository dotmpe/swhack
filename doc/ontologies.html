Vocabulary Documentation</p>

<h1>Vocabulary Documentation</h1>

<p>As we read and write N3, communicating in RDF, we need to share an
understanding of what each URI means.  We often pick URIs which offer
clues about meaning, such as
<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/demo1/biology#Dog</code>,
but the text of the URI still gives only a clue.  Would a wolf qualify
as a one of these?  How about a Dingo?  We can't tell just by looking
at the name.  It's even possible the URI text is misleading, and the
intended meaning has nothing to do with dogs.</p>

<p>A good technique for addressing these issues is to <a
href="../Primer#publish">publish</a> a document which 
carefully describes the intended meaning
of each term.  If this description is done carefully enough, following
a precise structure, software can help us understand what the terms
mean, check for some kinds of errors, and sometimes even dynamically
update itself to use and recognize new URIs.</p>

<p>There is a vocabulary of about fifty terms (URIs) being developed by
W3C Working Groups to support this kind of precise documentation.
About a dozen of the terms are part of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF Vocabulary
Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema</a>, for which we use the
"rdfs:" namespace abbreviation.   The others are part of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL Web Ontology
Language</a>.  
All fifty are all listed and
cross referenced in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#TermIndex">OWL Guide Appendix</a>
.</p>

<strong>@@@ Old Material</strong>






<p>In RDF, URIs are used a lot like was use words and phrases in natural
language.  Each URI has something it stands in place of, represents,
refers to, or denotes.  

<p>Each URI 

<p>An <em>ontology</em> or is a precise but sometimes incomplete
specification of a vocabulary. It often consists of both human-readable
documentation and machine-readable declarations.

the set of vocabulary terms along with human-readable
definitions of each term and machine-readable declarations about how the
terms relate to each other. An ontology embodies a conceptualization of some
subject area; to understand someone, you need to understand both their
grammar and all the ontologies they are using.</p>

<p>The process of developing an ontology is usually similar to the process of
object-oriented analysis and design: you figure out the classes of objects in
some subject area, then consider how instances of those classes relate to
each other (what is the class hierarchy?) and what they have in common
(what are the properties of each instance?).</p>

<p>With RDF ontologies, however, this analysis usually remains separated from
any programming language. Features likes inheritence and type-checking
remain, however, and can be of great value.</p>

<p>Historically, RDF has had a variety of ontology languages,
including <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDFS</a>, <a
href="http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-index.html">DAML+OIL</a>,
and OWL with its <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030210/#s1.3">three
different "species"</a>, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030210/#s2.1">OWL
Lite</a>, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030210/#s2.2">OWL
DL</a> and OWL Full.  However, with the exception of DAML+OIL which is
obsolete, they all fit together in OWL Full.  So use OWL Full, and if
you use only a restricted subset of the language, then you will have
additional performance guarantees.
</p>

<h2>Classes, Properties, Individuals, and Datatype Values</h2>

<p>In designing an ontology, it can be useful to divide the world into four different
kinds of things.  (Occasionally something will fit into more than one
of the areas; that's okay with OWL Full.)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <strong>individual</strong> is something in the domain of discourse,
    like a specific person, an inventory item, or a city. This roughly
    corresponds to "objects" in object-oriented programming. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>Arnold Schwarzenegger</li>
      <li>Budapest</li>
      <li>The Sun</li>
      <li>The French Revolution</li>
      <li>http://www.w3.org/ (the W3C front page)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>data value</strong> is something which can be fully
    represented by a sequence of characters. These correspond to values of
    primitive types in many programming languages. There is some flexibility
    about whether to model some things as individuals or a data values,
    especially when you have the option of defining a new datatype. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>the integer 17</li>
      <li>the string "Hello, World"</li>
      <li>the floating point number 3.771</li>
      <li>the date January 17, 1985</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>class</strong> is a grouping of individuals to reflect
    something they have in common. Classes may overlap arbitrarily. In some
    ontology languages classes may contain data values and other classes (or
    even themselves!), but it usually makes sense to restrict ourselves to
    classes of individuals as required by OWL DL and OWL Lite. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>Human</li>
      <li>Valid XHTML Document</li>
      <li>Member of the United Nations</li>
      <li>ActiveCustomer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>property</strong> relates an individual to something else,
    the value of that property for that individual. In the more restrictive
    languages, we have "data-valued properties" which have values which are
    datatype values, and "individual-valued properties" which have values
    which are individuals. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>date_of_birth</li>
      <li>lastName</li>
      <li>mayor</li>
      <li>purchaseMade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What is it for?</h2>

<p>An ontology can be used in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>By ontology creators, to keep the ontology logically consistent.</li>
<li>By data providers and consumers, to help communicate which
information might be provided and what the terms mean.
<li>By data providers and consumers, to help "validate" the 
data, finding constructs which are definitely or probably errors</li>
<li>By consumers, to license inferences, possibly from multiple
data sources, supporting data "fusion"</li>
</ul>


<h2>Subclass Reasoning</h2>
<pre>:Man s:subclassOf :Human .
:YoungMan s:subclassOf :Man .</pre>

<h3>OWL Inference</h3>
<pre>:Joe a :YoungMan --&gt;  :Joe a :Man. Joe a :Human.

Joe is a YoungMMMan --&gt;  [okay] </pre>

<h3>"Lint" Processing</h3>
<pre>Joe is a YoungMan --&gt;  [okay]

Joe is a YoungMMMan --&gt;  Warning: "YoungMMMan" used as a Class but
                                   not mentioned in schema.</pre>

<h2>Domain, Range, Cardinality</h2>

<p></p>
<pre>:father s:domain :Human; s:range :Man.
:Sara :father :Alan.
______________________________________
:Sara a :Human.  :Alan a :Man.


:father owl:cardinality "1".
:Sara :father :Alan.
:Sara :father :MrFoster.
___________________________________
:Alan = :MrFoster.

<h2>Sameness and Difference</h2>
