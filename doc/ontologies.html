Ontologies</p>

<h1>Ontologies</h1>

<p>An <em>ontology</em> is a precise specification of a vocabulary. It
typically consists of the set of vocabulary terms along with human-readable
definitions of each term and machine-readable declarations about how the
terms relate to each other. An ontology embodies a conceptualization of some
subject area; to understand someone, you need to understand both their
grammar and all the ontologies they are using.</p>

<p>The process of developing an ontology is usually similar to the process of
object-oriented analysis and design: you figure out the classes of objects in
some subject area, then consider how instances of those classes relate to
each other and what they have in common.</p>

<p>With RDF ontologies, however, this analysis usually remains separated from
any programming language. The features of inheritence and type-checking
remain, however, and can be of great value.</p>

<p>With RDF, we currently have four ontology languages. In order of
increasing expressive power:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDFS</a> is quite simple,
    but may be all you need.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030210/#s2.1">OWL
    Lite</a> is very strict and precise, but not very expressive. For many
    modeling tasks, it's a good place to start.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030210/#s2.2">OWL
    DL</a> is strict like OWL Lite, but offers all the standard Description
    Logic (DL) features.</li>
  <li>OWL Full removes many restrictions of OWL DL, making reasoning
    potentially intractable. (This replaces <a
    href="http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-index.html">DAML+OIL</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classes, Properties, Individuals, and Datatype Values</h2>

<p>In ontology development, one tends to divide the world into four different
kinds of things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <strong>individual</strong> is something in the domain of discourse,
    like a specific person, an inventory item, or a city. This roughly
    corresponds to "objects" in object-oriented programming. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>Arnold Schwarzenegger</li>
      <li>Budapest</li>
      <li>The Sun</li>
      <li>The French Revolution</li>
      <li>http://www.w3.org/ (the W3C front page)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>data value</strong> is something which can be fully
    represented by a sequence of characters. These correspond to values of
    primitive types in many programming languages. There is some flexibility
    about whether to model some things as individuals or a data values,
    especially when you have the option of defining a new datatype. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>the integer 17</li>
      <li>the string "Hello, World"</li>
      <li>the floating point number 3.771</li>
      <li>the date January 17, 1985</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>class</strong> is a grouping of individuals to reflect
    something they have in common. Classes may overlap arbitrarily. In some
    ontology languages classes may contain data values and other classes (or
    even themselves!), but it usually makes sense to restrict ourselves to
    classes of individuals as required by OWL DL and OWL Lite. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>Human</li>
      <li>Valid XHTML Document</li>
      <li>Member of the United Nations</li>
      <li>ActiveCustomer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>property</strong> relates an individual to something else,
    the value of that property for that individual. In the more restrictive
    languages, we have "data-valued properties" which have values which are
    datatype values, and "individual-valued properties" which have values
    which are individuals. 
    <ul class="example">
      <li>date_of_birth</li>
      <li>lastName</li>
      <li>mayor</li>
      <li>purchaseMade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>OWL Inference</h3>
<pre>:Joe a :YoungMan --&gt;  :Joe a :Man. Joe a :Human.

Joe is a YoungMMMan --&gt;  [okay] </pre>

<h3>"Lint" Processing</h3>
<pre>Joe is a YoungMan --&gt;  [okay]

Joe is a YoungMMMan --&gt;  Warning: "YoungMMMan" used as a Class but
                                   not mentioned in schema.</pre>

<h2>Domain, Range, Cardinality</h2>

<p></p>
<pre>:father s:domain :Human; s:range :Man.

______________________________________
:Sara a :Human.  :Alan a :Man.


:father owl:cardinality "1".
