################## The following are used for inference


log:Truth a rdf:Class;
	rdfs:comment "Something which is true: belive it as you would belive this.
	Understood natively by cwm."

log:Falsehood a rdf:Class;
	rdfs:comment "Something which is not true. Not the complement of True!"

log:implies a rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:comment "Logical implication. Understood natively by cwm." .

############# Rules
# Rule names may change.
# Conversion between falsehood and implication:
