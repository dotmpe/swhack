<> dc:description """change policy vocabulary and rules

in a discussion of an ontology hosting service, it seemed
useful to support formalized change policies; meanwhile,
the TAG has been writing on the subject of language extensibility.

This is an attempt to transcribe the TAG text into N3 and
use it to build a change policy vocabulary.

I'd also like to formalize policies like the RDF Calendar
'subject to change with notice to www-rdf-calendar' policy.
