The os:environ property of a string is the value corresponding to
the string when looked up in the curent environment.  This is
not, of course, something of global significance: it is only
used in local processing for passing parameters into a semantic web
processor.

os:environ is a built-in function in cwm, and corresponds
to Python's os.environ[] .

os:argv a rdf:Property, ont:UniqueProperty;

    rdfs:isDefinedBy <>;
    rdfs:comment"""
    The object is looked up as the literal string which was given
as the nth command line argument. For example, cwm uses a "-with" argument
to indicate that the following args should be passed to the RDF system.

Example:
    cwm foo.n3 -think -with bar baz
    when processing,   {"1" os:argv "bar". "2" os:arv "baz"} will be true.
    
    The os:argv property allows one to make statements whose interpretation
is relative to the conditions pertaining at the time of execution. Beware
of writing axioms about these, in making optimizations for example about
reuse of information between runs.  The uniqueness of this property pertains
to one run of a program.  The ont:UniqueProperty may be removed if it
messes up more complex processing."""
