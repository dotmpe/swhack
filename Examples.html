<h2 id="Rules">Rules making rules</h2>

<p>The a transitive property, like ancestor, is one such that if Fred is Joe's
ancenstor, and Joe is Bill's ancenstor, then Fred is Bill's ancenstor.  That
(for all Fred, Joe and Bill)  is a  rule for "ancenstor", and the fact that
that is true for any transitive property in place of "ancenstor" is the
definition of transitivity. </p>
<ul>
  <li>rules12.n3 has the "implies" rules to draw the above conclusion in two
    stages, first concluding a specific rule for ancenstor from the general
    rule for transitivity, and secondly using it in the specific case of Fred
    and company.</li>
  <li>rules13.n3 has hte same, but uses "log:means" (a bidirectional
    implication) to indicate that transitivity is that and only that. "Means"
    is not a primitive for cwm, so it is defined in terms of log:implies. This
    doesn't then acheive anything spectacularly new otherwise.</li>

<h2>KIF to RDF: Converting axioms</h2>

<p>There were some axioms for RDF and RDFS and DAML prodcued by Deborah
McGuiness and Fikes for the DAML work, in KIF.  KIF list syntax is pretty like
N3 list syntax so a sed file converts the KIF to N3 list syntax. Then, a bunch
of rules decorate the lists with their equivalent in N3.  The result is quite
a mess, but all the intermediate results are labelled as "log:Chaff".  This
magic class has the feature in cwm that -purge removes any statements from the
store which mention (as subject, verb or object) anything which is in class
Chaff.</p>

<p>The process is very recursive, and so uses the -think option on cwm, which
iterates over all rules. It takes (2001/02) a long time, partly beccause it is
not directed in its simple-minded approach, and partly because it is not
optimised.  The rules are by no means complete, so the axoim set is not
translated in its entirity. This example is unfinished but still may be
instructive.</p>

<h2 id="Parser">Parser test files</h2>

<p>These are ismple semantic web examples in N3 and RDF syntaxes made
typically in order to test the software, but you can use them to test your
understanding.</p>
<ul>
  <li>s1.n3   some simple schema information</li>
  <li>animal.rdf  a little DAML ontology about an animal</li>
  <li>double-conclusion.n3  Testing that a reasoner wouldn't draw duplicate
    conclusions</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
