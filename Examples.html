<h1>Examples - Getting into RDF &amp; Semantic Web  using N3</h1>

<p></p>

<p>This is a collection of examples to accompany the <a
href="Primer.html">Primer. </a> (The files have URIs starting
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/ if you are reading this on paper.)  These
are designed as examples, to show how something can be done, not as working
products.</p>

<p>Remember, to convert an n3 file into RDF,  <code>cwm xxx.n3 -rdf </code>
should do it  among other things.  I haven't exhaustively tested all
combinations of n3 and RDF in all cases.</p>

<h2 id="Schema">Schema validation</h2>

<p>In the semantic web, there are many different forms of document validity.
One useful form is to check that the document doesn't violate any rules
associated with the vocabularies it uses, and that for each namespace it uses,
every term it uses is actually mentioned in the schema for that namespace.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="test/daml-ex.n3 ">daml-ex.n3</a>  An example schema using
  DAML</li>
  <li><a href="test/invalid-ex.n3 ">invalid-ex.n3</a>  A document which
    declares terms in an invalid way</li>
  <li><a href="test/schema-rules.n3">schema-rules.n3</a> A set of rules about
    the DAML vocabulary</li>
  <li><a href="test/schema-filter.n3">schema-filter.n3</a> A filter to remove
    all the worlkings and preserve just the result</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line I used with the closed world machine was</p>
<pre>cwm daml-ex.n3 invalid-ex.n3 schema-rules.n3 -think -filter=schema-filter.n3</pre>

<p>This combines the schema, the document and the rules, and draws all
possible conclusions, then filters out any conclusions of invalidity.</p>

<p>The rules are by no means complete, and this is by no means the only way to
do validation. A special-purpose program would be more efficient of cource.
However, this demonstrates how easy it is when data is a semantic form to
process it using a general purpose engine.</p>

<h2 id="Rules">Rules making rules</h2>

<p>The a transitive property, like ancestor, is one such that if Fred is Joe's
ancenstor, and Joe is Bill's ancenstor, then Fred is Bill's ancenstor.  That
(for all Fred, Joe and Bill)  is a  rule for "ancenstor", and the fact that
that is true for any transitive property in place of "ancenstor" is the
definition of transitivity.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="test/rules12.n3">rules12.n3</a> has the "implies" rules to draw
    the above conclusion in two stages, first concluding a specific rule for
    ancenstor from the general rule for transitivity, and secondly using it in
    the specific case of Fred and company.</li>
  <li><a href="test/rules13.n3">rules13.n3</a> has hte same, but uses
    "log:means" (a bidirectional implication) to indicate that transitivity is
    that and only that. "Means" is not a primitive for cwm, so it is defined
    in terms of log:implies. This doesn't then acheive anything spectacularly
    new otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>KIF to RDF: Converting axioms</h2>

<p>There were some axioms for RDF and RDFS and DAML prodcued by Deborah
McGuiness and Fikes for the DAML work, in KIF.  KIF list syntax is pretty like
N3 list syntax so a sed file converts the KIF to N3 list syntax. Then, a bunch
of rules decorate the lists with their equivalent in N3.  The result is quite
a mess, but all the intermediate results are labelled as "log:Chaff".  This
magic class has the feature in cwm that -purge removes any statements from the
store which mention (as subject, verb or object) anything which is in class
Chaff.</p>

<p>The process is very recursive, and so uses the -think option on cwm, which
iterates over all rules. It takes (2001/02) a long time, partly beccause it is
not directed in its simple-minded approach, and partly because it is not
optimised.  The rules are by no means complete, so the axoim set is not
translated in its entirity. This example is unfinished but still may be
instructive.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Makefile  contains the recipes - files are all in the dpo
  subdirectory</li>
  <li>axioms.txt  was cut and pasted from the axiomatic semantics
  document</li>
  <li>axioms.n3 is the result ofmaking this into N3 format for the KIF
  lists</li>
  <li>axioms.sed was the stream editor file used to do that;</li>
  <li>kludge.n3 labels everything in the file as an axiom</li>
  <li>consts.n3 is a list of all the constants which are deemed the same in
    KIF and N3</li>
  <li>convert.n3 has the actual rules for deriving some N3 expressions from
    some KIF expressions;</li>
  <li>result.n3 is the result of conversion</li>
  <li>purged,n3 is the result of converting and purging the log:Chaff;</li>
  <li>purged2.n3 is the result of purging it still futher (too far!) removing
    all lists as well</li>
  <li>noKIF.n3 is the file usedto do that, to label all lists as
  log:Chaff.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Parser">Parser test files</h2>

<p>These are ismple semantic web examples in N3 and RDF syntaxes made
typically in order to test the software, but you can use them to test your
understanding.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="test/s1.n3 ">s1.n3 </a>  some simple schema information</li>
  <li>animal.rdf  a little DAML ontology about an animal - from a DAML
    discussion</li>
  <li>double-conclusion.n3  Testing that a reasoner wouldn't draw duplicate
    conclusions</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
