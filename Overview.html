<h1>Semantic Web Area for Play</h1>

<p></p>

<p>or, if you like, <em>Semantic Web Application Platform</em>...  visiting
RDF and all points west.</p>

<p>This NOT W3C endorsed material, it is related to the Semantic Web activity
of the W3C.</p>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>This stuff is not guaranteed but is open source and available from the <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/">w3c CVS repository</a>. </p>

<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>These are a few things I put together to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolve the fact that I had no code development environment</li>
  <li><a href="#L88">Check out python</a></li>
  <li>Investigate the questions of the real RDF model particularly with
    respect to
    <ul>
      <li>alternative quick scribbling (wiki wiki?) syntax - notation3</li>
      <li>managing several bags of RDF data, not covered by the RDF spec</li>
      <li>relationships between this and rule languages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Generate some tools for munging RDF</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The bits are now as follows. There is NO guarantee or support or anything
for these.</p>

<h2 id="Python">Python modules</h2>

<h3 id="L133">Serializing/deserializaing RDF: notation3.py</h3>

<p>Originally written by Dan Connolly, uses a basic RDF stream parser
interface</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses N3</li>
  <li>Generates RDF</li>
  <li>Generates N3</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line form  (alias n3 python notation3.py; n3 -help) allows RDF
to be parsed and re-output.</p>

<p>The module will also run as a CGI script to convert N3 to RDF M&amp;S 1.0 -
by DanC magic.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="notation3.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="L88">By the way... Python is cool.</h3>

<p>I had lamented that it ws a long time since I had a practial hacking
environment, and Dan Connolly suggested <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> as something you could start quickly
but which would scale to a large system.  One day, 15 minutes before I had to
leave for the airport, I got my laptop back out of my bag, and sucked off the
web the <a href="http://www.python.org/1.6/">python 1.6 system</a> and the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html">python tutorial</a>, and
a copy of a small <a href="../n3/notation3.py">notation3 parser</a> Dan had
hacked together. I was happy to find that Python is a language you can get
into on one battery!  I have been happily hacking ever since.</p>

<p>I remember Guido trying to persuade me to use python as I was trying to
persuade him to write web software!</p>

<h3 id="L311">xml2rdf.py   Parsing RDF</h3>

<p>Based on Python's xmllib, this parser is ocmpatible with the RDF stream
interface of, notation3.py.  It completes the square of parsers and
generators.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses RDF</li>
</ul>

<p>It has a command line mode for self-test purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="xml2rdf.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3 id="Closed">Closed World Machine : cwm.py</h3>

<p>This is a triple store, in which triples are stored in/against the
particular context in which they were read, eg RDF file or N3 { expression }.
The features at the moment include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading files in RDF and/or N3</li>
  <li>Applying rules written in N3 to the data.</li>
  <li>Filtering the data to the result of a particular query</li>
  <li>Generating RDF or N3 files from the result.</li>
  <li>Pretty printing data so that anonymous nodes are used creatively to
    minimize the number of explicit existentials (generated Ids).</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Cwm will run as a unix command, and is designed to be usable as a simple
data manipulator for RDF on the lines of sed, awk, etc or xsl.</p>

<p>In progress.</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="Command">Command line parameters</h4>

<p>Some, marked (flag), can occur anywhere on the command line.  The others
are processed in order from left to right.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>-help</dt>
    <dd>generate a <em>maybe</em> more up to date list of parameters</dd>
  <dt>-pipe</dt>
    <dd>don't store, just process serially. (doesn't lose comment lines!)
      (flag)</dd>
  <dt>-rdf</dt>
    <dd>input format RDF format from now on</dd>
  <dt>-rdf1out</dt>
    <dd>output format is RDF. (flag)</dd>
  <dt><em>uri</em></dt>
    <dd>load the resource. Parsed relative to the local directory, so a
      filename will work.</dd>
  <dt>-size</dt>
    <dd>Output the current size of the store.</dd>
  <dt>-apply=<em>uri</em></dt>
    <dd>Apply the rules in a given resource, once each, to the store, the
      conclusions being added to the store.</dd>
  <dt>-filter=<em>uri</em></dt>
    <dd>Apply the rules in a given resource, once each, to the store,
      replacing the original contents of the store with those things concluded
      from the rules.</dd>
  <dt>-rules</dt>
    <dd>Apply any rules in the store to the store itself, conclusions being
      added to the store.</dd>
  <dt>-ugly</dt>
    <dd>Dump the store in a more or less random order. This tends to be messy,
      as related information is not grouped.</dd>
  <dt>-bySubject</dt>
    <dd>Dump the store grouping statements by subject. This tends to be better
      than -ugly, but the default is to make the output as readable as
      possible using anonymous nodes wherever possible, and is therefore
      recommended. (flag)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that where a <em>uri </em>is given, this can be a filename of course.
The default base URI of the process is the file URI of a file in the current
working directory, so a local filename will be a valid relative URI. This is
how URIs were supposed to work.</p>

<h4 id="Rule">Rule file format</h4>

<p>A rule file is simply a notation3 file. A rule is a statement which asserts
an implication using log:imples (where the namespace must be
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#) between premise and a conclusion. The
premise is simply a template: cwm will search for all combinations of
statements in the store which match the template.  Variables must be
explicitly connected to the enclosing context (often, the document) by a
"log:forAll" statement. For each match, a conclusion is formed by taking the
conclusion and in it replacing any variables which have been matched with the
values found. The following is an example:</p>
<pre>@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt; .
@prefix mech: &lt;s1.n3#&gt; .

&lt;&gt; log:forAll &lt;#x&gt; , &lt;#y&gt; .
{ &lt;#x&gt; mech:includes &lt;#y&gt; } log:implies { &lt;#y&gt; mech:partOf &lt;#x&gt; } .</pre>

<p>The @prefix directives define the prefixes log: and mech: as representing
namespaces.   The &lt;&gt; log:forAll line declares #x and #y, two local
identifiers, as being univerlly quantified variables in the context of this
document (&lt;&gt;).</p>
