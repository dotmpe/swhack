<h1>Semantic Web Area for Play</h1>

<p></p>

<p>or, if you like, <em>Semantic Web Application Platform</em>...  visiting
RDF and all points west.</p>

<p>This NOT W3C endorsed material, it is related to the Semantic Web activity
of the W3C.</p>

<p>Other related material:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notation3</li>
  <li><a href="http://infomesh.net/2001/cwm/">Sean Palmer's guide to
  cwm</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2000/10/swap/">stuff</a> is not
guaranteed but is open source and available from the <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/">public w3c CVS repository</a>.</p>

<h3>Cwm - a general-purpose semantic web data processing tool</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="doc/cwm.html">The cwm home page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Check out *.py from the top level of the swap hierarchy to use it, check
out the whole tree to develop.</p>

<p>Set up an alias (.bat file, etc) to make the cwm command  cwm="python
/wherever/cwm.py"</p>

<h3>Other utilities in python</h3>
<ul>
  <li>onnvert Quicken(tm) dat ainto RDF</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ontologies</h2>

<p>These are lists of RDF terms (properties and classes) which we have used
for putting together test and demo applications, and organizing our dailiy
lives.  Most are defined in n3, many have xml versions. If you don't have it
in XML, use cwm  to transcode it.</p>

<h3>cwm built-ins</h3>

<p>For cwm these are magic - these are properties which cwm can infer or
which allow cwm to infer things. They are like built-in functions in a
programming language.  Not every N3 processor handles the same built-ins.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logic - as used by cwm</li>
  <li>String - built in</li>
  <li>Math - builtin</li>
  <li>crypto</li>
</ul>

<h3>Utility ontologies</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="pim/contact.n3">contact information - address book
    etc</a><a></a></li>
  <li><a href="pim/doc.n3">document management - versioning
  etc</a><a></a></li>
  <li>circles and arrows diagrams</li>
  <li>issue tracking</li>
  <li>organizational structure</li>
  <li>roadmap project dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic RDF ontologies</h3>

<p>Not here, but things everyone needs</p>
<ul>
  <li>The RDF schema vocabulary</li>
  <li>The DAML+OIL web ontology vocabulary</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Motivation">History: Motivation</h2>

<p>These are a few things I put together to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolve the fact that I had no code development environment</li>
  <li><a href="#L88">Check out python</a></li>
  <li>Investigate the questions of the real RDF model particularly with
    respect to
    <ul>
      <li>alternative quick scribbling (wiki wiki?) syntax - notation3</li>
      <li>managing several bags of RDF data, not covered by the RDF spec</li>
      <li>relationships between this and rule languages</li>
      <li>a generic logic framework for implementing various systems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Generate some tools for munging RDF</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3 id="L88">By the way... Python is cool.</h3>

<p>I had lamented that it ws a long time since I had a practial hacking
environment, and Dan Connolly suggested <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> as something you could start quickly
but which would scale to a large system.  One day, 15 minutes before I had to
leave for the airport, I got my laptop back out of my bag, and sucked off the
web the <a href="http://www.python.org/1.6/">python 1.6 system</a> and the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html">python tutorial</a>,
and a copy of a small <a href="../n3/notation3.py">notation3 parser</a> Dan
had hacked together. I was happy to find that Python is a language you can
get into on one battery!  I have been happily hacking ever since.</p>

<p>I remember Guido trying to persuade me to use python as I was trying to
persuade him to write web software!</p>
