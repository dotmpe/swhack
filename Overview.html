<h1>Semantic Web Area for Play</h1>

<p>or if you like Semantic Web Application Platform...</p>

<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>These are a few things I put together to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolve the fact that I had no code development environment</li>
  <li>Check out python</li>
  <li>Investigate the questions of the real RDF model particularly with
    respect to
    <ul>
      <li>alternative quick scribbling (wiki wiki?) syntax - notation3</li>
      <li>managing several bags of RDF data, not covered by the RDF spec</li>
      <li>relationships between this and rule languages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The bits are now as follows. There is NO guarantee or support or anything
for these.</p>

<p>Pyton modules</p>

<h3 id="L133">Serializing/deserializaing RDF: notation3.py</h3>

<p>Originally written by Dan Connolly, uses a basic RDF stream parser
interface</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses N3</li>
  <li>Generates RDF</li>
  <li>Generates N3</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line form  (alias n3 python notation3.py; n3 -help) allows RDF
to be parsed and re-output.</p>

<p>The module will also run as a CGI script to convert N3 to RDF M&amp;S 1.0 -
by DanC magic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3 id="Closed">Closed World Machine : cwm.py</h3>

<p>(pronounced roughly: coom as in room) This is a triple store, in which
triples are stored in/against the particular context in which they were read,
eg RDF file or N3 { expression }. The features at the moment include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading N3 files.</li>
  <li>Applying rules written in N3 to the data.</li>
  <li>Generating RDF or N3 files from the result.</li>
  <li>Pretty printing data so that anonymous nodes are used creatively to
    minimize the number of explicit existentials (generated Ids).</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Cwm will run as a unix command, and is designed to be usable as a simple
data manipulator for RDF on the lines of sed, awk, etc or xsl.</p>

<p>In progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Notation 3 - an alternative RDF syntax</li>
  <li>Quantification implicit in anonymous nodes</li>
</ul>
