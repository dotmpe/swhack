<h2 id="Motivation">History: Motivation</h2>

<p>These are a few things I put together to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolve the fact that I had no code development environment</li>
  <li><a href="#L88">Check out python</a></li>
  <li>Investigate the questions of the real RDF model particularly with
    respect to
    <ul>
      <li>alternative quick scribbling (wiki wiki?) syntax - notation3</li>
      <li>managing several bags of RDF data, not covered by the RDF spec</li>
      <li>relationships between this and rule languages</li>
      <li>a generic logic framework for implementing various systems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Generate some tools for munging RDF</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3 id="L88">By the way... Python is cool.</h3>

<p>I had lamented that it ws a long time since I had a practial hacking
environment, and Dan Connolly suggested <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> as something you could start quickly
but which would scale to a large system.  One day, 15 minutes before I had to
leave for the airport, I got my laptop back out of my bag, and sucked off the
web the <a href="http://www.python.org/1.6/">python 1.6 system</a> and the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html">python tutorial</a>,
and a copy of a small <a href="../n3/notation3.py">notation3 parser</a> Dan
had hacked together. I was happy to find that Python is a language you can
get into on one battery!  I have been happily hacking ever since.</p>

<p>I remember Guido trying to persuade me to use python as I was trying to
persuade him to write web software!</p>
