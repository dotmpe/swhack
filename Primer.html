<h1>RDF &amp; Semantic Web Primer using N3</h1>

<p></p>

<p>The world of the semantic web, as based on RDF, is really simple at the
base.  This articile shows you how to get started.  It uses a simplified
teaching language which is basically equivalent to RDF in its XML syntax, but
easier to scribble when getting started.</p>

<h2 id="L553">Subject, verb and object</h2>

<p>In RDF, information is simply a collection of statements, each with a
subject, verb and object - and nothing else. In N3, you can write an RDF
triple just like that, with a period:</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#knows&gt; &lt;#jo&gt; .
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Everything, be it subject, verb, or object, is idenified with a Universal
Resource Identifier.  This is something like &lt;http://www.w3.org/&gt; or 
&lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/s1.n3#includes&gt;, but when
everything is missed out before the "#" it identifies &lt;#pat&gt; in the
current document whatever it is. </p>

<p>There is one excption that the object (only) can be a string representing a
value:</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#knows&gt; &lt;#jo&gt; .
&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#age&gt; "24" .
</pre>

<p>The verb "knows" is in RDF called a "property" and thought of as a noun
expressing a relation between the two. In fact you can write</p>
<pre>
&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt; &lt;#al&gt; .
</pre>

<p>alternatively, to make it more readable, as either</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; has &lt;#child&gt; of &lt;#al&gt; .
</pre>

<p>or</p>
<pre>&lt;#al&gt; is &lt;#child&gt; of &lt;#pat&gt; .
</pre>

<p>There are two shortcuts for when you have several statements about the same
subject: a semicolon ";" introduces another property of the same subject, and
a comma introduces another object with  the same predicate and subject.</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt;  &lt;#al&gt;, &lt;#chaz&gt;, &lt;#mo&gt; ;
       &lt;#age&gt;    "24" ;
       &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "blue" .</pre>
<pre>So for example the data in hte table
</pre>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>age</td>
      <td>eyecolor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pat</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>al</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>jo</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>green</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>could be written</p>
<pre>  &lt;#pat&gt;   &lt;#age&gt; "24";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "blue" .
  &lt;#al&gt;    &lt;#age&gt;  "3";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .
  &lt;#jo&gt;    &lt;#age&gt;  "5";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .</pre>
<pre></pre>

<p>Sometimes there are things involved in a statement don't actually have any
identifier you want to give them - you know one exists but you only want to
give the properties .  You represent this by square brackets with the
properties inside.</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt; [ &lt;#age&gt; "4" ] , [ &lt;age&gt; "3" ].
</pre>

<p> You could read this as #pat has a #child which has #age of "4" and a
#child which has an #age of "3".  There are two important things to
remember</p>
<ul>
  <li>The identifiers are just identifiers - the fact that the letters p a t
    are used doesn't tell anyone or any machine that we are talking about
    anyone whose name is "Pat" -- unless we say &lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#name&gt;
    "Pat".  The same applies to the verbs - never take the actual letters c h
    i l d as telling you what it means - we will find out how to do that
    later.</li>
  <li>The square brackets declare that something exists with hte given
    properties, but don't give </li>
</ul>

<p>If we actually wany to use a name, we could have written the table above
as</p>
<pre>  [ &lt;#name&gt; "Pat"   &lt;#age&gt; "24";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "blue"  .].
  [ &lt;#name&gt; "Al"    &lt;#age&gt;  "3";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .].
  [ &lt;#name&gt; "Jo"    &lt;#age&gt;  "5";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .].</pre>

<p>There are many ways of combining square brackets - but you can figure that
out from the examples later on. There is not much left learn about using N3 to
express data, so let us move on.</p>

<h2 id="Sharing">Sharing concepts</h2>

<p>The semnctic web can't define in one document what something means. That's
something you can do in english (or occasionally in math) but when we really
communicate using the concept "title", (such in a library of congress catalog
card or a web page), we rely on a shared concept of "title".  On the semantic
web, we share quite precicely by using exactly the same URI for the concept of
title.</p>

<p>I could try to give the title of an N3 document by</p>
<pre>&lt;&gt; &lt;#title&gt;  "A simple example of N3".

</pre>

<p>The &lt;&gt; being a blank URI just refers to the document it is written
in. The &lt;#title&gt; refers to the concept of #title as defined by the
document itself.  This won't mean much to the reader. However, a group of
people created a list of properties called the Dublin Core, among which is
thier idea of title, which they gave the identifier</p>

<p>&lt;@@@@@@@@@#title&gt;. So we can make a much better defined statement if
we say </p>
<pre>&lt;&gt; &lt;@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@#title&gt;  "A simple example of N3".


</pre>

<p>That of course would be a bit verbose - imagine using such long identifiers
for everything like #age and #eyecolor above. So N3 allows you to set up a
shorthand prefix for the long part. This is called a namespace identifier, and
you set it up using "@prefix" like this:</p>
<pre>@prefix dc:  &lt;@@@@@@@@@@@&gt; .
&lt;&gt; dc:title  "A simple example of N3".

</pre>

<p>Note that when you use a prefix, you use a colon instead of a hash between
dc and title, and you don't use the &lt;angle brackets&gt; around the whole
thing.  This is much quicker.  This is how you will see and write almost all
your predicates in N3.  Once set up, a prefix can be used for the rest of the
file (* may change).</p>

<p>There are an increasingly large number of RDF vocabularies for you to refer
to - check the RDF home page - and you can build your own nes for your own
applications very simply.</p>
