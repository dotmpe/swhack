<h1>RDF &amp; Semantic Web Primer using N3</h1>

<p></p>

<p>The world of the semantic web, as based on RDF, is really simple at the
base.  This articile shows you how to get started.  It uses a simplified
teaching language which is basically equivalent to RDF in its XML syntax, but
easier to scribble when getting started.</p>

<h2 id="L553">Subject, verb and object</h2>

<p>In RDF, information is simply a collection of statements, each with a
subject, verb and object - and nothing else. In N3, you can write an RDF
triple just like that, with a period:</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#knows&gt; &lt;#jo&gt; .
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Everything, be it subject, verb, or object, is idenified with a Universal
Resource Identifier.  This is something like &lt;http://www.w3.org/&gt; or 
&lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/s1.n3#includes&gt;, but when
everything is missed out before the "#" it identifies &lt;#pat&gt; in the
current document whatever it is. </p>

<p>There is one excption that the object (only) can be a string representing a
value:</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#knows&gt; &lt;#jo&gt; .
&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#age&gt; "24" .
</pre>

<p>The verb "knows" is in RDF called a "property" and thought of as a noun
expressing a relation between the two. In fact you can write</p>
<pre>
&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt; &lt;#al&gt; .
</pre>

<p>alternatively, to make it more readable, as either</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; has &lt;#child&gt; of &lt;#al&gt; .
</pre>

<p>or</p>
<pre>&lt;#al&gt; is &lt;#child&gt; of &lt;#pat&gt; .
</pre>

<p>There are two shortcuts for when you have several statements about the same
subject: a semicolon ";" introduces another property of the same subject, and
a comma introduces another object with  the same predicate and subject.</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt;  &lt;#al&gt;, &lt;#chaz&gt;, &lt;#mo&gt; ;
       &lt;#age&gt;    "24" ;
       &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "blue" .</pre>
<pre>So for example the data in hte table
</pre>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>age</td>
      <td>eyecolor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pat</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>al</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>jo</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>green</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>could be written</p>
<pre>  &lt;#pat&gt;   &lt;#age&gt; "24";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "blue" .
  &lt;#al&gt;    &lt;#age&gt;  "3";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .
  &lt;#jo&gt;    &lt;#age&gt;  "5";  &lt;#eyecolor&gt; "green" .</pre>
<pre></pre>

<p>Sometimes there are things involved in a statement don't actually have any
identifier you want to give them - you know one exists but you only want to
give the properties .  You represent this by square brackets with the
properties inside.</p>
<pre>&lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#child&gt; [ &lt;#age&gt; "4" ] , [ &lt;age&gt; "3" ].
</pre>

<p> You could read this as #pat has a #child which has #age of "4" and a
#child which has an #age of "3".  There are two important things to
remember</p>
<ul>
  <li>The identifiers are just identifiers - the fact that the letters p a t
    are used doesn't tell anyone or any machine that we are talking about
    anyone whose name is "Pat" -- unless we say &lt;#pat&gt; &lt;#name&gt;
    "Pat".  The same applies to the verbs - never take the actual letters c h
    i l d as telling you what it means - we will find out how to do that
    later.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
